# SOFTWARE

### Tools

R, RStudio, Latex, Stata, Python


### R Packages under Development

[`RFA`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/RFA) - Implements [random forest adjustment](https://rpubs.com/milesdwilliams15/rfa-vignette) (RFA). RFA is a method for partialing out the influence of confoudning covariates via random forests.

[`seerrr`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/seerrr) - Tools that simplify the process of doing computational power analysis.

[`SARM`](https://github.com/milesdwilliams15/SARM) - For estimating a modified version of the Strategic Autoregressive Model developed by [Steinwand (2011)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/estimating-freeriding-behavior-the-stratam-model/0CBD6176E53848732CEC2C151A491212).

`oesr` (available soon, with Ryan T. Moore) - For visualizing the results from randomized controlled trials using the Office of Evluation Sciences' [recommended style guide](https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/reporting-statistical-results.pdf).
